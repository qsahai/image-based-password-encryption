# login-system-using-image-based-password-encryption
This is a basic login system that utilizes an encryption algorithm based on specific pixel color values (via OPenCV) of a given JPEG as a seed to encrypt passwords.
A basic program I have created using the same encryption algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/qsahai/image-based-string-encryption
